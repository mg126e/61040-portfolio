**Application pitch**

<br>

**Name**  <em>Academica</em>

<br>

**Motivation**
Let students quickly compare classes by professor ratings, section times, and fulfillment of graduation requirements to make planning their academic schedule quick and efficient.

**Features**
  -	**Filters:** Students can search for courses by code or name and apply filters such as department, course level, professor ratings, and graduation requirements. The course data, tags, and filtering logic work together to present only the classes that match the selected criteria. This reduces the overwhelming number of options, helping students quickly find courses that are relevant to their major and graduation plan.
  -	**Visualize Schedule:** Students can add and remove courses to build multiple schedules and see how their weekly timetable would look. They can then export the finalized schedule to their Google Calendar. This feature combines scheduling data, course information, and calendar export functionality, allowing students to experiment with different combinations, avoid conflicts, and coordinate with extracurricular activities. It helps them plan efficiently and feel confident about their schedule.
