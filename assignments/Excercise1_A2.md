**Problem statement**

<br>

**Domain:** Academic Schedule Planning\
I get excited when the courses for the upcoming semester are released, and I can start planning my schedule. I cross reference interesting classes with courses that fulfill graduation requirements to narrow down my options. I take class times, professor ratings, and workload into account and I always compare at least three potential schedules before settling on one to apply for. I would love to find a platform that can help me weigh these factors and suggest classes that fit my needs.

**Problem:** Comparing Classes\
I feel like I devote a significant amount of time searching for Wellesley’s degree requirements for my class year and my progress toward completing them. I then create a spreadsheet of all the classes I am interested in and what degree requirements they fulfill. After narrowing down the classes, I compare the course times to start creating schedule options. I then decide on a primary schedule with at least one back up for every class. Given this long process, I think I am spending too much time planning my schedule for registration.

**Stakeholders:**
  - Students could spend less time planning their schedule while making more informed decisions.
  - Wellesley Professors that teach additional sections of a class could receive more students as the section is at a more convenient but comes up second in searches on Workday.

**Evidence:**
-	[“50% of the PSY group and 40% of the CS group”](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.4113) said they would use software for academic advising support to try “what-if” scenarios such as trying different schedules.
-	The introduction of [personalized recommendations increases the consumption of content by 60%](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13940). The researchers conclude personalized recommendations increase engagement for veteran users on educational apps.
-	In the study Cognitive Complexity and Degree Planning: [Student Perceptions of and Needs From Technology Tools](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385266076_Cognitive_Complexity_and_Degree_Planning_Student_Perceptions_of_and_Needs_From_Technology_Tools?utm_source=chatgpt.com), the researchers found that student progression and completion is hindered by inaccurate degree planning.
**Comparable:**
-	[University of Wisconsin Madison](https://news.wisc.edu/6-steps-to-building-the-perfect-college-schedule/): an app catered to their student body for class registration with specific features to streamline registration given their specific graduation and registration requirements.
-	[Coursicle](https://www.coursicle.com/): A website to help college students plan and register for classes and get notified when classes have availability.
